# python_challenges
This repo originally started out as a folder to hold my homework assignments. Now that I am a graduate, I'm going back and brushing up on my Python basics in an attempt to master the fundamentals. My original assignemnts will remain since I hope to be able to improve upon my old code once I feel more confident with the language.
